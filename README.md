# prng
A custom PRNG algorithm which is still in development.
A PRNG or Pseudorandom Number Generator is an algorithm to create numbers which "looks" random. Since the computers are the most rational machines ever built, it's not possible to achieve complete randomness using them. That's why we need PRNG's. A PRNG takes a seed, makes some calculations on it and produces a new number. My algorithm uses both the decimal and binary versions of seeds and when needed (too big numbers give memory or overflow errors) it crops them. Yep, you read it right. Just like a string. After applying the algorithm on recursion several times, it produces a result. And also if you don't want to deal with finding a seed, it gives an opportunity to use some digits from the current time. Below, I put a screenshot of a graph which shows some values I generated with the algorithm, to show you the nearly-randomness.
